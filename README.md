# Coursera-Machine-Learning-Classification
## IPython notebook solutions for University of Washington's Classification course of the Machine Learning specialization in Coursera
This course goes somewhat deep in classification methods that are widely used in practice, including logistic regression with
regularization, decision trees, boosted trees, online learning and stochastic gradient descent etc. From the course page
"you will create classifiers that provide state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks.  You will become familiar with
the most successful techniques, which are most widely used in practice, including logistic regression, decision trees and 
boosting.  In addition, you will be able to design and implement the underlying algorithms that can learn these models at
scale, using stochastic gradient ascent.  You will implement these technique on real-world, large-scale machine learning
tasks.  You will also address significant tasks you will face in real-world applications of ML, including handling missing
data and measuring precision and recall to evaluate a classifier.  This course is hands-on, action-packed, and full of 
visualizations and illustrations of how these techniques will behave on real data.  We've also included optional content 
in every module, covering advanced topics for those who want to go even deeper! ".
